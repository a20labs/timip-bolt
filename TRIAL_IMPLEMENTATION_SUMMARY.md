# 14-Day Trial Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully updated the Starter plan from "Free" to "Free for 14 days" with automatic conversion to paid subscription after trial period.

## Changes Made

### 1. **ArtistLanding.tsx**
- Updated pricing display from "Free" to "Free for 14 days"
- Modified plan description to reflect trial period

### 2. **stripe-config.ts**
- Added TypeScript interface `StripeProduct` with `trialDays` property
- Updated Starter plan configuration:
  - Description: "14-day free trial then $19.99/month..."
  - Added `trialDays: 14` property
  - Updated features to include "14-day free trial"

### 3. **useSubscription.ts**
- **New subscription tier**: Added `'trial'` to `SubscriptionTier` type
- **Updated tier hierarchy**: `free: 0, trial: 1, pro: 2, enterprise: 3`
- **New function**: `isTrialExpired()` to check trial status
- **Enhanced `getCurrentTier()`**: Now detects `subscription_status === 'trialing'`
- **Updated `checkFeatureAccess()`**: Handles trial users and expired trials
- **Enhanced return object**: Added `isTrialExpired` property
- **Updated price mapping**: `price_1RdyvG4fVYS0vpWMUUyTvf9q` now maps to `'trial'`

### 4. **UI Components Updated**
- **Sidebar.tsx**: Displays "STARTER (TRIAL)" for trial users
- **Settings.tsx**: Shows "Starter (14-Day Trial)" and appropriate description
- **LandingPage.tsx**: Updated all "30-day" references to "14-day"
- **SubscriptionPage.tsx**: Updated trial text to "14-Day Free Trial"
- **TermsOfService.tsx**: Updated legal text to reflect 14-day trial period

## Subscription Logic

### Trial States
- **`trialing`**: User is in active 14-day trial period
- **`active`**: Trial converted to paid subscription
- **`past_due`**: Trial ended, payment failed
- **`canceled`**: User canceled during or after trial

### Feature Access
- **Free users**: Limited access (tier 0)
- **Trial users**: Enhanced access (tier 1) - same as Starter plan features
- **Expired trial**: Falls back to free tier access (tier 0)
- **Paid users**: Full access based on their plan (tier 2-3)
