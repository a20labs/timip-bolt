# Artist Navigation & Upgrade Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented Artist navigation for users with the Artist role on the Starter plan, with proper upgrade paths to Pro Artist or Indie Label for more features.

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. PAM Service Updates (`src/services/pamService.ts`)
- **Added Demo Users**: Added `artistdemo@truindee.com` and `fandemo@truindee.com` with proper roles and subscription tiers
- **Enhanced Mock Data**: Updated user mock data to include `subscriptionTier` field (`free`, `pro`, `enterprise`)
- **Upgrade Logic**: Added methods for:
  - `getUserSubscriptionTier()` - Get user's current subscription tier
  - `canUpgradeTo()` - Check if user can upgrade to specific tier
  - `getUpgradeOptions()` - Get available upgrade options based on user role

### 2. Navigation System (`src/hooks/useNavigation.ts`)
- **Artist Access**: Artists get full CREATOR_NAVIGATION with all features
- **Free Tier Support**: Items with `subscription_tiers: ['free', 'pro', 'enterprise']` are visible to starter plan artists
- **Upgrade Prompts**: Items requiring upgrades have `subscription_tiers: ['pro', 'enterprise']` and show upgrade prompts
- **Role-Based Filtering**: Navigation items properly filtered by user role

### 3. Subscription & Upgrade System (`src/components/ui/SubscriptionBanner.tsx`)
- **Artist-Specific Upgrades**: For artists on free tier, shows two upgrade options:
  - **Pro Artist**: Unlimited tracks, advanced analytics, full AI team access
