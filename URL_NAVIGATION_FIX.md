# URL Navigation Fix

## Issue
When clicking "See Demo" or "Artist Demo" buttons on the landing page, users were redirected to `/auth`, but after successful authentication or demo login, the URL remained at `/auth` instead of updating to reflect the actual screen being displayed (e.g., dashboard).

## Root Cause
The `AuthPage` component was updating the authentication state using `setUser()` but was not navigating to the appropriate route after successful authentication. The app relied on conditional rendering based on authentication state, but the URL didn't update accordingly.

Additionally, there was a race condition between state updates and navigation calls that prevented the URL from updating properly.

## Solution
Added proper state-driven navigation using `useEffect` to ensure navigation happens after authentication state is properly updated:

### Changes Made:
1. **Added React Router navigation**: Imported and used `useNavigate` hook in `AuthPage.tsx`
2. **Added state-driven navigation**: Used `useEffect` to monitor user state changes and navigate accordingly
3. **Fixed race conditions**: Used `shouldNavigate` state to track when navigation should occur
4. **Post-authentication navigation**: 
   - Regular users (demo or sign-in) → navigate to `/` (dashboard)
   - Super admin → navigate to `/admin` (admin dashboard)
5. **Fixed React Router warnings**: Added future flags for v7 compatibility
6. **Fixed all authentication flows**:
   - Password sign-in → navigate to dashboard
   - Sign-up → navigate to dashboard 
   - Demo login (artist/fan) → navigate to dashboard
   - Super admin demo → navigate to admin dashboard

### Files Modified:
- `src/components/auth/AuthPage.tsx`
  - Added `useNavigate` and `useEffect` imports
  - Added state-driven navigation with `shouldNavigate` state
  - Added `useEffect` to handle navigation after authentication
  - Fixed TypeScript types for `ExtendedUser`
  - Cleaned up unused imports
- `src/App.tsx`
  - Added React Router future flags to eliminate warnings

### Technical Details:
- **Navigation Strategy**: Instead of immediate navigation after `setUser()`, the component now sets a `shouldNavigate` state that triggers navigation via `useEffect` when the user state is confirmed to be updated
- **Race Condition Fix**: The `useEffect` ensures navigation only happens after the user authentication state is properly set
- **Future Compatibility**: Added `v7_startTransition` and `v7_relativeSplatPath` flags for React Router v7 compatibility

## Testing
- ✅ "See Demo" buttons now properly update URL after authentication
- ✅ Sign-in flows redirect to correct dashboard
- ✅ Super admin flows redirect to admin dashboard
- ✅ URL always reflects the actual screen being displayed
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ No React Router warnings
- ✅ No race conditions between state updates and navigation

## User Experience Impact
- **Before**: URL stayed at `/auth` even after viewing dashboard
- **After**: URL correctly shows `/` for dashboard or `/admin` for admin panel
- Users can now bookmark the correct pages
- Browser back/forward buttons work correctly
- URL sharing works as expected
- Clean console without React Router warnings
