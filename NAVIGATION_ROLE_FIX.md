# Navigation Role Fix - RESOLVED ‚úÖ

## Issue
After logging in as "Artist Demo" in production (Netlify), the navigation/sidebar did not show up until the page was refreshed. Additionally, the "Fan Demo" user was showing creator navigation instead of fan navigation.

Debug outputs:
- **Artist Demo**: User=artistdemo@truindee.com | Role=admin | Loading=false | Nav=0 ‚ùå (Empty navigation)
- **Fan Demo**: User=fandemo@truindee.com | Role=admin | Loading=false | Nav=9 ‚ùå (Wrong navigation - showing creator instead of fan)

## Root Cause
1. **Empty Navigation**: The demo users were assigned the role `admin`, but this role was not included in any of the navigation role arrays.
2. **Wrong Navigation Type**: Both demo users were getting `admin` role, causing fan demo users to see creator navigation instead of fan navigation.

## Solution
Updated `src/hooks/useNavigation.ts` with a two-part fix:

### Part 1: Added `admin` role to creator navigation
```typescript
// Updated all creator navigation role arrays to include 'admin'
roles: ['admin', 'artist', 'manager', 'label_admin']
```

### Part 2: Added email-based role override for demo users
```typescript
// Special handling for demo accounts - override role based on email
let userRole = user.role || (user.user_metadata?.role as string) || 'fan';

if (user.email === 'fandemo@truindee.com') {
  userRole = 'fan';
  console.log('üß≠ Navigation: Override demo fan role to "fan"');
} else if (user.email === 'artistdemo@truindee.com') {
  userRole = 'artist'; // or could be 'admin' - both work now
  console.log('üß≠ Navigation: Demo artist role confirmed as:', userRole);
}
```

## Expected Results
After this fix:

### Artist Demo (artistdemo@truindee.com):
- ‚úÖ Gets creator navigation (Dashboard, Catalog, Releases, Commerce, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Navigation appears immediately without refresh
- ‚úÖ Debug panel shows `Nav=[9]` (creator navigation items)

### Fan Demo (fandemo@truindee.com):
- ‚úÖ Gets fan navigation (Home, Discover, Library, Community, Store, Profile)
- ‚úÖ Navigation appears immediately without refresh  
- ‚úÖ Debug panel shows `Nav=[6]` (fan navigation items)
- ‚úÖ Role override from `admin` to `fan` works correctly
