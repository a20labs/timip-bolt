# PAM (Privileged Access Management) System Development Plan

## Overview
Developing a comprehensive PAM system for the TruIndee platform to manage privileged access, role-based permissions, and security policies.

## Core Components

### 1. Role Management System
- **Hierarchical Roles**: Define role hierarchy and inheritance
- **Dynamic Role Assignment**: Runtime role assignment and modification
- **Role Templates**: Predefined role configurations for common use cases

### 2. Permission Management
- **Granular Permissions**: Fine-grained access control for resources
- **Permission Groups**: Logical grouping of related permissions
- **Resource-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Control access to specific resources

### 3. Access Control Engine
- **Policy Evaluation**: Real-time policy evaluation and enforcement
- **Context-Aware Access**: Location, time, and device-based access control
- **Just-in-Time (JIT) Access**: Temporary elevated permissions

### 4. Audit & Compliance
- **Access Logs**: Comprehensive logging of all access attempts
- **Audit Reports**: Regular compliance and security reports
- **Risk Assessment**: Automated risk scoring and alerts

### 5. Admin Interface
- **User Management**: Centralized user administration
- **Role Designer**: Visual role and permission configuration
- **Policy Builder**: Drag-and-drop policy creation
- **Dashboard**: Real-time security metrics and alerts

## Implementation Phase 1: Core Foundation
1. Enhanced Role System
2. Permission Framework
3. Access Control Engine
4. Basic Admin Interface

## Implementation Phase 2: Advanced Features
1. JIT Access
2. Risk-Based Authentication
3. Advanced Audit System
4. Compliance Reporting

## Implementation Phase 3: Enterprise Features
1. Multi-Tenant Support
2. Advanced Policy Engine
3. API Security
4. Integration Capabilities

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase with Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with advanced security features
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with custom policies
- **Logging**: Structured logging with audit trails

## Security Considerations
- Zero Trust Architecture
- Principle of Least Privilege
- Defense in Depth
- Regular Security Audits
- Compliance with SOC 2, ISO 27001

## Next Steps
1. Create enhanced role and permission models
2. Implement core access control engine
3. Build admin interface for PAM management
4. Add comprehensive audit logging
5. Develop compliance reporting features
